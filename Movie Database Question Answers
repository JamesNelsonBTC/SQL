How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
WHERE type='Movie';

When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?

SELECT Max(date(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.

SELECT title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title asc

Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?

SELECT director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
ON titles.show_id=people.show_id
WHERE titles.title='Bright Star';

What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?

SELECT title, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie'
ORDER BY release_year asc
LIMIT 2;

NOTE: I found there were two movies that were released in the same year by changing the limit from one to two and then to three.
      This told me that it was two movies were the "oldest".
